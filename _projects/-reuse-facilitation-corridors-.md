Introduction: Across New York City, youth-focused spaces like schools, libraries, and after-school programs help shape where learning, participation, and community life already happen. At the same time, reuse, repair, and material education often exist in separate networks and reach some neighborhoods and groups more easily than others. This project looks at how everyday youth engagement and reuse-oriented practice might intersect more intentionally. Rather than proposing new sites or programs, the maps focus on what already exists and ask where connections are visible, where gaps remain, and how access to reuse education might be expanded through familiar community spaces.

Approach: This project uses youth engagement as a lens for thinking about access to reuse education. After-school programs are treated as everyday sites of participation where learning, care, and collective activity already take place. The analysis maps where reuse & repair organizations fall within the neighborhood-scale reach of these programs, highlighting opportunities for connection and collaboration.

Data + Scope: Proximity is explored at a neighborhood scale to suggest everyday access rather than formal service boundaries. Reuse & repair organizations were compiled into a custom dataset based on publicly available information and their alignment with educational and participatory practices within the city. This project does not capture all forms of participation, such as informal or inconsistently documented spaces such as repair cafés, pop-up workshops, recreation centers, and community gardens. Where access, programming, or youth engagement cannot be reliably inferred from spatial data alone. These spaces are very much just as important parts of the reuse ecosystem and represent directions for future expansion of this living map.
