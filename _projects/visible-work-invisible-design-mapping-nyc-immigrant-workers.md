This project uses spatial mapping as a method to examine the urban conditions shaping the daily mobility of delivery workers in New York City - a workforce that is largely immigrant, highly mobile, and often invisible within conventional planning datasets. Rather than attempting to map precise delivery routes or real-time movement, the project focuses on preparing and assembling a set of base spatial layers that make this population legible within the city’s existing public space and mobility infrastructure.

The core of the work involved extensive data processing and normalization across multiple New York city open datasets. These include: public plazas, parks, open streets, street improvement corridors, bike parking infrastructure, street vending licenses, food carts near parks, and census-based estimates of employment in courier and messenger services. These datasets were produced by different agencies, at different spatial scales, and for different policy purposes. A significant portion of the project consisted of cleaning geometries, reconciling coordinate systems, simplifying features for web mapping, and standardizing attributes so that layers could be meaningfully compared and overlaid.

Because delivery work is defined by movement rather than fixed workplaces, the project intentionally avoids treating delivery workers as a static population tied to singular locations. Instead, census-derived estimates of courier and messenger employment are used as a proxy for residential concentration. The maps emphasize relationships rather than routes: proximity to public plazas and parks as informal rest spaces, access to bike parking as essential work infrastructure, proximity to public toilets and the overlap of vending, open streets, and street improvement corridors as indicators of everyday service ecologies that support delivery labour.

The final output is a series of interactive web maps generated through QGIS and exported using open-source tools. These maps allow users to toggle layers on and off, foregrounding how different infrastructures intersect with delivery worker geographies. The interactivity is not intended as a surveillance tool, but as a way to reveal absences, misalignments, and concentrations in the city’s spatial provision for a mobile workforce.

Overall, instead of mapping being representative of individual movement, it is a planning instrument that, at this stage, translates fragmented administrative data into a shared spatial language for understanding how urban design, public space, and infrastructure condition the lives of immigrant workers in New York city.
