#### Project Overview
Over the past twenty-five years, New York City’s digital infrastructure has expanded rapidly. Enabled largely through public–private partnerships, this transformation has replaced analog public amenities with networked systems: payphones with LinkNYC kiosks, paper tickets with digital payment platforms, and in-person service provision with mobile and web-based portals. Within this tech-entrepreneurial paradigm of urban governance, digital infrastructure has become not only a feature of urban life, but a key mechanism for urban citizenry. 

While these systems are often framed as tools of efficiency and inclusion, privacy advocates have raised concerns about the growing role of private entities in the provision of public infrastructure and drawn light to the expansion of unsolicited surveillance. As Mark Andrejevic argues, “If land enclosure helped produce the spatial conditions for the exploitation of wage labor, digital enclosures enable the exploitation of information generated by users as they go about their daily lives.” This project takes that claim forward by asking how the rollout of New York City's digital infrastructure reshapes residents’ exposure to surveillance and data extraction.

#### Methodology and Data
The project consists of two primary mapping efforts. The first examines the rate of change in New York City’s digital infrastructure. It analyses the introduction and spatial distribution of public Wi‑Fi, LinkNYC kiosks, Citi Bike stations, CCTV cameras, OMNY and TAPP readers. 

To produce this map, I collected, cleaned, processed, and standardised six datasets sourced from NYC Open Data, Amnesty International, and Citi Bike. The initial iteration combined all variables into a single CSV file and visualised them in QGIS using a heat map. This approach revealed concentrations of digital infrastructure in areas such as Midtown East, West Harlem, and Downtown Brooklyn. Drawing on the STOP Report NYC Surveillance Handbook, I also identified the types of data collected by different infrastructures.

However, by collapsing all variables into a single category, the heat map reduced the analysis to overall density. While useful for identifying hotspots, this method obscured distinctions between infrastructure types, and the data they collect, making it difficult to identify more nuanced spatial patterns or governance logics.

#### Temporal Analysis and Iteration
A second limitation of the initial map was its inability to represent change over time. To address this, I reprocessed the datasets to include temporal attributes and created a time-enabled map using Foursquare’s timeline functionality. This allowed for visualisation of when different forms of digital infrastructure were introduced across the city.

At the same time, I wanted to integrate qualitative, non-spatial information, such as policy shifts, platform launches, and regulatory developments, into the analysis. So to bring in a qualitative analysis I wanted to encorporate a timeline documenting key policy decisions, governmental initiatives, and the launch of major apps and digital platforms since 2000. To do this, I returned to QGIS and designed a map intended for conversion to Mapbox, paired with a scroll-based narrative interface.

While this approach successfully integrated spatial and contextual information, it limited user'’ ability to freely explore the map. This prompted a further refinement of the project’s goals, shifting from a purely illustrative narrative toward a more interactive and analytical framework focused explicitly on surveillance.

#### Surveillance, LinkNYC, and Digital Inclusion
To explore the surveillance implications of expanding digital infrastructure, I initially conducted a buffer analysis around LinkNYC kiosks, using a 150-foot radius corresponding to the kiosks’ reported operational range. I examined arrest data within these buffers, informed by investigative reporting by The Intercept (2018), which documented instances of law enforcement accessing LinkNYC data.

The introduction of LinkNYC offers a particularly instructive case. Launched in 2016 by the private consortium CityBridge, LinkNYC is framed as a digital inclusion initiative, providing free public Wi‑Fi, device charging, and information services. Physically, each 9.5‑foot aluminum-and-glass kiosk contains digital displays, interactive screens, multiple cameras, and sensors, and operates continuously. In use, they collect and store personally identifiable information, including names, email addresses, and unique device identifiers, enabling the tracking of users’ movements over time.

A close examination of a high-density cluster of LinkNYC kiosks near NYPD Transit Bureau District 30 in Downtown Brooklyn raises further questions. The concentration of kiosks in this area may suggest that infrastructures designed to promote digital access also function to extend surveillance capacity. While this relationship requires further empirical analysis, it underscores the uneven human costs embedded in ostensibly free public services. As technology policy analyst Benjamin Dean notes, “When you’re not paying, you’re not the customer — you’re the product.”

#### Interactive Mapping Outcome

To bring these insights into an interactive format, I developed a second, explorable map that foregrounds data collection practices. This map visualizes where New York City’s digital infrastructures gather personal data and what types of data are collected as residents move through or interact with these systems. Beneath the promise of free public services, whistleblowers and privacy advocates have raised persistent concerns about how “free” these public goods truly are. Developed through public–private partnerships, these infrastructures grant private contractors varying levels of access to urban data streams.
The map is intended to make visible the otherwise opaque geographies of data extraction that structure everyday urban life.

#### Future Directions
Future iterations of this project will investigate whether the introduction of specific forms of digital infrastructure correlates with changes in arrest rates or policing intensity in surrounding areas. Additional datasets, such as those related to automated license plate readers (e.g. Flock Safety / DeFlock), will be incorporated to further expand the analysis of surveillance technologies across the city.
