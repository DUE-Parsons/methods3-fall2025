#### Framework
Relational Timekeeping and Timemaking
![]({{ page.img-folder }}wmo0Oe0.png)

Relational Timekeeping and Timemaking refers to understanding urban time through the interaction of multiple rhythms: ecological rhythms such as day and night, seasons, and climate patterns; bodily rhythms, including the daily and cyclical needs of human bodies; historical temporality, shaped by long arcs of memory and inherited cultural rituals; social time, formed through patterns of encounter and intersubjectivity; and mobility rhythms, which describe when people leave, commute, and how long it takes to get places. Rather than treating time as a single clock-based system, this approach focuses on how these different temporal layers overlap, interact, and shape everyday urban life.


#### Mobility Rhythms
This project investigates mobility rhythms across New York City as part of the Temporality Analysis Toolkit. Focusing on patterns of daily movement, I used QGIS to map when New Yorkers leave for work across neighborhoods, and Foursquare Studio to zoom in on Corona Plaza Subway Station in order to examine local mobility rhythms within the surrounding community.

This set of maps analyzes time leaving for work across New York City by breaking the morning commute into hourly intervals, from early morning (0–5 AM) through the peak commute hours (7–9 AM) and into later-in-the-day departures. Using American Community Survey “Journey to Work” data, the maps show how different neighborhoods participate in the workday at different times, revealing uneven temporal patterns across the city. Earlier departures concentrate in specific areas and corridors, while later time windows show a wider spread across neighborhoods, suggesting differences in job types, commute distances, and daily schedules. Seen together, these maps make visible how commuting time is not uniform across NYC but varies spatially, producing distinct mobility rhythms across neighborhoods.

This web map is part of the Temporality Analysis Toolkit and supports analysis of local mobility rhythms centered on Corona, Queens across 2024. It uses estimated MTA subway origin–destination ridership data to examine how inbound and outbound travel patterns vary by hour and day of week.
The interactive flow map visualizes hourly subway connections to and from Corona, with line thickness representing estimated average ridership. Summary charts highlight key temporal patterns, including Outbound Ridership by Hour, Weekly Busiest Outbound Hour, and Top Destinations from Corona, alongside Inbound Ridership by Hour, Weekly Busiest Inbound Hour, and Top Origins to Corona.
The dataset is derived from scaled OMNY and MetroCard swipe data provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority via NYC Open Data. Estimates are available for the first half of each month in 2024. Together, the spatial and temporal views reveal daily commuting cycles, peak travel periods, and Corona’s role within the subway network.
